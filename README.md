MaticGasStation Network is a REST API service that provides current gas price recommendations for Polygon PoS and Zkevm transactions. This service offers developers a convenient way to retrieve real-time gas prices and make informed decisions about transaction fees on the Polygon PoS and Zkevm network.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maticnetwork/
$ npm install
```

-   Prepare `.env` file & paste following content in .env.sample file into it. You may want to check [configuratoin](#configuration).

```bash
touch .env
```

Example

```
POS_RPC=<pos rpc url>
ZKEVM_RPC=<zkevm rpc url>
PORT=7000
SAFE=5
STANDARD=15
FAST=30
HISTORY_BLOCKS=15
```

-   Run service

```bash
npm start
```

-   Run tests
